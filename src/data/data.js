  `Hi! I'm Alden de Loyola, a Software Developer from Cebu City, Philippines. I am a full-stack developer with expertise in creating website applications
  using architectures like MVC and restful API's. With a proven knack of building the backend and database of systems, I can also create user
  interfaces to compliment the system and make them whole - all in the pursuit of creating usable systems that caters to the needs of anyone. I believe in the transformative
  power of Computer Science to change the world.`

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Since 2023, I hold a BS Computer Science degree from the University of the Philippines Cebu. I have an approximately two years
industry experience working mostly on creating backend and database of systems. Maintaining this limited field of expertise held me back from achieving the ultimate potential
of a meaningful and useful degree, so I freed myself from the limits of backend development, went out of my comfort zone to learn frontend. Everytime I go home\
from my 9-hour shift job, I would convert my night's remaining free times (2 to 3 hours) to upskill.
In this way, I knew I could obtain the power of creating useful systems. Since then, I always knew I loved to create something out of nothing. It was only until recent times where I
realized that this philosophy applies in programming, too - the ability to be able to create something out of mere lines of codes.`

    career especially on backend development. In this internship, I was solely assigned to create an API for a system that works like bit.ly wherein a URL is converted to a shortened one

      This website is for a music band called "IV OF SPADES", which has two principal features: (1) display of Artist Analytics and Statisics, and (2) a Social Media for the band's fans.
      For the Analytics/Statistics part, data is scraped from Spotify (will soon utilize Spotify API) to display a ranking of the most streamed tracks all-time (All-Time), a ranking of the most streamed 
      tracks for the current period of time (Trending Now), and Artist Analytics - which I have employed several statistical tools such as coefficient of variation to rank the artist based on the 
      consistency of their streams across all tracks.

      On the other side, this website also has a social media feature where users can register and log in their profile. They can interact with other users by posting on the "Fan Board" where they can also
      react on the posts of others, much like a simple version of Twitter.
